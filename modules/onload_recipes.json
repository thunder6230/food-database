"instructions": "Pit the dates and chop them up into little pieces. In a medium sauce pan, combine water, dates and maple syrup and bring to a boil, stirring often. Once at a boil, add the citrus peels and stir. Turn the heat down to medium and cook down until most of the water is gone. When it starts to look like jam, its done. Place sauce pan in a freezer to quickly cool down the mixture.\nWhen date jam is cooled, preheat the oven to 400F and begin to prepare the rest of the recipe.\nCombine flour, baking soda, salt and oats in a bowl and whisk together.\nIn another large mixing bowl, beat sugar and butter until creamy.\nAdd the dry ingredients to the butter and cream and mix with a spatula or large wooden spoon until completely mixed. The texture will look quite crumbly.\nCoat  a 13x9-inch metal baking pan with cooking spray. Then begin layering your ingredients carefully.\nA.Layer half of the crumb mixture and press down in the pan to make the bottom layer crust.\nB.CAREFULLY spread your date jam on top of the crumb crust using a spatula sprayed with some oil.\nC.Finally, sprinkle the remainder of the crumb mixture on top of the date jam.\nBake for about 20-30 minutes, until the top is golden.\nCool completely before cutting.",

"instructions": "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick saute pan over medium heat. Add in the chopped shallot, garlic and bacon, cooking until the shallot softens and then bacon begins to crisp up nicely.\nToss in the mushrooms (make sure you've sliced any large ones), sauteing everything together for another 5-6 minutes, or until the mushrooms reach your desired consistency (tender, but not falling apart).\nMeanwhile, cook the pasta until it is al dente. I prefer to use a nice whole wheat fettuccine for this recipe as it pairs well with the nuttiness of the mushrooms. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and set aside.\nAdd the peas and parsley to the skillet, season with salt and pepper and cook for just a minute or two before tossing in the pasta and mixing well, coating the pasta with the oils and fat.\nRemove the skillet from the heat and put the pasta into a large serving bowl. Shave a generous amount of Parmeggiano Reggiano over the dish, tossing to combine.\nServe with additional cheese and salt and fresh pepper, to your liking.",

Stir together.\nPlace all ingredients, except fruit, into a bowl. Using an electric beater or KitchenAid mixer, beat ingredients together for approximately 1 minutes.\nPeel a whole apple and thinly chop into pinky nail size pieces.\nStir the apples into the oatmeal mixture.\nPour the mixture into greased pan and press entire mixture down firmly with your fingers.\nPlace pan into the oven and cook for 25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. If you are using an 11x13 pan, it will take a bit less time because the mixture will be much thinner.\nLet cool for 10 minutes before slicing into strips.

Remove from the heat.\nIn a small food processor add the dried apricots, raisins, dried cranberries, parsley and the onion mushrooms mixture.  Pulse for a few times until everything is minced and well combined.\nCut the tenderloin in half crosswise. Butterfly each sections making sure not to go completely thru the meat.\nSalt and pepper generously each section. Spread the onion mushroom mixture over on side. Place the other half of the meat  over the mixture and seal the sides with toothpicks. Season generously with salt and pepper on each side.\nIn the same pan that the onions were cooked, heat  teaspoon of olive oil and add the pork tenderloin. Sear each side for about 3-5 minutes.\nPlace in the hot over and cook for another 20 to 30  minutes, or until no juices are running off the pork tenderloin.\nRemove from the oven, transfer the meat on a dish and cover with aluminum foil.\nPour off any fat from the pan, or bits of meat that may have fallen from the pork.  Add the marsala and port wine. Bring to a boil and with a spatula scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add any pan juices from the tenderloin and continue cooking until the sauce is reduced to  cup. Remove from the heat and add the butter and cream. Swirl around to ensure butter is melted.\nRemove the toothpicks and cut the pork tenderloin crosswise. Arrange on a plate and pour the sauce over it, or alongside.",

"instructions": "<p>Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, cinnamon. Stir in milk and egg until just combined. Fold in apple. Pour oil into skillet so that it is approximately 1 1/2 deep. Heat oil on high. Oil is ready when a little dough thrown in floats to top. Carefully add dough to oil in heaping teaspoons. Cook until brown, about 2 minutes, then flip. Cook another 1-2 minutes, until both sides are browned. Transfer briefly to paper towels to absorb excess oil, then transfer to cooling rack. Make glaze by stirring milk and powdered sugar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over apple fritters. Wait approximately 3 minutes for glaze to harden, then flip fritters and drizzle glaze over the other side. Best served warm.</p>",

"instructions": "Start by melting a stick of butter in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave the butter for 30 second intervals until the butter has completely melted.\nThen whisk in some granulated sugar.\nNext, whisk in two eggs.\nNow you're going to mix together some buttermilk and baking soda and pour this into the mixture. Stir until well combined.\nLastly, pour in cornmeal, flour, salt, shredded cheddar cheese, and canned diced jalapenos! Make sure you mix this until the mixture is *just* combined. Don't over mix, or you'll end up with tough bread!\nPreheat your oven to 375 degrees F and prepare a pan with cooking spray. I used a mini loaf pan very similar to this mini loaf pan, but an 8 x 8 pan would work, too! Although, the cooking time may vary. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and top the batter with thinly sliced fresh jalapenos.\nBake for about 25 to 35 minutes - again, the cooking time may vary depending on the size of your pan.\nRemove from the oven, and let the loaves cool in the pan for a few minutes.\nRemove from the pan and let set on a cooling rack until you're ready to serve!",

"instructions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 8 or 9 inch round cake pans and sprinkle with tapioca flour if youre making a layer cake. Otherwise, line a muffin tin with baking cups.\nMix together the coconut flour, tapioca flour, salt, xanthan gum, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.\nBeat the eggs, sugar, and mayonnaise until fluffy.\nThen slowly add the vanilla, flour mixture, and milk. Alternating between the flour and milk to make a nice fluffy cake. Note- I usually use just barely under 3/4 C of the milk alternative.\nPour the batter into the greased cake pans or fill the baking cups 3/4 full (makes 24 cupcakes).\nBake for 20-25 minutes for the cakes or 12-15 minutes for the cupcakes. Cakes are done when they are nicely browned and spring back when lightly touched or when a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool completely before icing.\nFor The Icing:\nBring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Place a heatproof bowl over the saucepan (make sure the water isnt touching the bottom) and add the chocolate and butter.\nStir until melted. Then, add the remaining ingredients.\nPlace uncovered in freezer for 15 minutes.\nBeat with hand mixer until light and fluffy. If its too runny, place back in freezer a few minutes and repeat process until the icing is a good consistency.",

If you want larger chin chin chunks, do not roll it out so thin, If you want regular sized chin chin, roll it out so its relatively thin but not all the way.With a knife, cut the chin chin to your desired shape and set aside.In a pan of hot oil for deep frying, place your chin chin dough and allow to fry till its golden brown. Place in a paper towel to allow the excess oil to be absorbed and for it to cool down.If using an oven, pre-heat the oven to 370 F and place the chin chin dough on a lined foil container and bake for about 30-35 minutes or until browned.If you want it sweeter, sprinkle some powdered sugar on the top or add more sugar to the initial recipe.P.s: This is more of an in between recipe, its not completely soft. If you want it extra soft, you can use 2cups of flour.   ",

Once well combined fold in the sliced bananas carefully.  Pour into a 13x9 baking dish and cook for 90 minutes or until completely set.  This can be served hot, room temp or cold. It can be topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or as I did with the following topping.\nIn a sauce pan over medium high heat melt the butter then add the brown sugar.  Once melted add the banana slices and stir gently, cook until the syrup has reduced and the bananas have caramelized.  This will take about 5-10 minutes, be careful to not let your sugar burn.
